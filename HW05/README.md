# HW05
## Description

1. **Implement RBF networks** 

2. **apply your RBFN to the ‘circle in the square’ data**

   •two training data sets: cis_train1.txt and cis_train2.txt

   •one test set: cis_test.txt

   •report your parameters and accuracies

3. **apply your RBFN to the ‘function approximation’ data**

   •two training data sets: fa_train1.txt and fa_train2.txt

   •one test set: fa_test.txt

   •report your parameters and MSEs
