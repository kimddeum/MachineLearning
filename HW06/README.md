# HW06
## Description

- Implement and apply LDA to MNIST to find 2, 3, 5, 9 dim spaces. 
  (you can use LDA from scikit-learn with a panelty, then don\'t get confused with Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
  - compare them to the corresponding eigenspaces (PCA) 
    in classification accuracy (with kNN and random forest)
  - use scikit-learn for kNN and random forest. 
  - for 2dim space, plot the samples and compare LDA and PCA
